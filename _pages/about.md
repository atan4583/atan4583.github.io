I am intrinsically curious and passionate about connecting technology with measurable business value, improvising existing tools/methods to create newer, better means to empower optimal business operations.

Naturally, I thrive on continuous learning, applying my knowledge to problem solving which in turn enhances my knowledge competency. The nature of problems I look to solve daily entails analyzing patterns and trends of data behind the problems and choosing the most appropriate analytical techniques and tools to come up with best fit data-driven solutions.

This site contains a collection of recent project artifacts from my learning journey, feel free to browse through them and let me know if you have feedbak or ideas to help refining the artifacts and promoting continuous learning.

Happy browsing & cheers, :star2: !!!
